# AAtesting

## What did I learned in this course?
 I used Junit to create blackbox tests,Used Mockito to create Unit tests and watch them
 in grafical interface, then mockit use mockito to stop a certain step,

## How is this repository structured?
First and foremost there is no framework utilized here,there are a couple of projects
the first one is a simple dice roll

but it brings up a movie service, with a 
payment app parcel.
